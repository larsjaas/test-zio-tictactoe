Following ZIO tutorial at https://scalac.io/blog/write-command-line-application-with-zio/,
using ZIO 1.0.0-RC16 and Scala 2.13.8.

I gave up on Scala 3 and ZIO 2.0.0-RC2 for this zio kata because of all of the incompatibilities.
I'll jump back to Scala3/ZIO2 exclusively after completing this tutorial.
